This games was for ludum dare 37 https://ldjam.com/ and made in about 48 hours

2017, the dinopocalypse. Thunderlizards emerge from their subterranean slumber
with their eyes on world domination. One man holds the key to cast them back
to the center of the earth, but he is stranded in a single-room research lab
in rural Alabama.

Do you have what it takes to defeat General Ankyleesaurus's horde?

Installing
----------

```
git clone https://github.com/fdorothy/dinopocalypse.git
cd dinopocalypse
./gradlew desktop:run
```

See libgdx (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) for more info on running
on different platforms. I've only tested on a Linux desktop.

Rules
-----

You must survive 9 waves of attacks from the thunderlizard horde. Each wave
is separated by a 1 minute wait period for you to build up the defenses in
your single-room research lab.

Touch the screen to move the research around.

Touch a thunderlizard to shoot at it. But be warned, you cannot shoot through blocks.

Some thunderlizards take a few shots to kill.

If you press the 'pickup' button in the lower-left color then you can pickup
items that are laying around the area. You can only pickup one item at a time.
After pushing the button click the item and you will move there and pick it up.

You can press the 'drop' button the lower-left color if you have an item and
want to drop it off somewhere. Click again on the screen to select where you
want to drop it.
